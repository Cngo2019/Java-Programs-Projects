The class files are assignment 4 of MIT's "Introduction to Programming in Java" course.
After completing assignment 4, I decided to build upon the assignment by creating a library management system for the user to 
interact with.

Part 1:
Complete assignment 4 on MIT's "Introduction to Programming in Java" course. Code the 'Book.java' and 'Library.java' class files 

Part 2:
Create a library management system that allows the user to create multiple libraries. Within
these libraries, allow the user to add books with specific titles. 

Allow the user to search a book, return a book, borrow a book, etc.
