Programming Started: January 15, 2020 (Writing and working with all the code)
Completed: January 23, 2020

The class files are assignment 4 of MIT's "Introduction to Programming in Java" course.
After completing assignment 4, I decided to build upon the assignment by creating a library management system for the user to 
interact with.

Part 1:
Complete assignment 4 on MIT's "Introduction to Programming in Java" course. Code the 'Book.java' and 'Library.java' class files 

Part 2:
Create a library management system that allows the user to create multiple libraries. Within
these libraries, allow the user to add books with specific titles. 

Allow the user to search a book, return a book, borrow a book, etc.

SUMMARY OF PROJECT:

In the main menu, the user will have an array that holds Library data type values. When creating the Library object using the Library.java
file, each one of our libraries will have an address and an array that holds Book data types values. Each specific book in the array has a 
title and a boolean variable that tells us whether or not it has been rented. 
The main menu allows the user to access these books and libraries starting from the library array.

LIBRARY -> COLLECTION OF BOOKS -> SOME BOOK -> TITLE
    |                                 |
    V                                 V
    ADDRESS                         BORROWED?
